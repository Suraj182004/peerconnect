**PeerConnect** is a student-centric networking platform meticulously designed to bridge the gap between students, fostering collaboration, and enabling the discovery of peers with shared interests and project goals. This frontend application aims to replicate key functionalities of professional networking sites like LinkedIn but is exclusively tailored for the unique needs and context of the student community. Our goal is to empower students to build meaningful connections, share knowledge, and embark on collaborative ventures within a supportive and focused environment.

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance

PeerConnect offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance the student networking and collaboration experience:

-   **Intuitive Onboarding & Rich Profile Customization**: A seamless, multi-step onboarding process guides new users to create detailed profiles. Users can input personal information, academic credentials (college ID, year, department, university), showcase a portfolio of skills (technical and soft), list academic and extracurricular interests, and define areas for project collaboration. The platform also supports profile picture uploads to personalize user accounts.
-   **Personalized & Dynamic Dashboard**: Upon login, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard serving as their central hub. It features a welcoming message, at-a-glance statistics (e.g., connection count, profile views), quick action buttons for easy navigation to key sections (Browse Peers, View/Edit Profile, Manage Connections), a (simulated) feed of recent activities from their network, and intelligent (simulated) connection suggestions based on profile similarity or shared interests.
-   **Advanced Peer Discovery & Intelligent Filtering**: A powerful peer discovery module allows students to efficiently find and connect with others. Users can browse profiles in either a grid or list view, utilize an advanced search bar with debounced, real-time filtering, and apply a multitude of filters including department, academic year, specific skills, project interests, and university. Sorting options for search results (e.g., by newest members, most connections, or similarity of interests) further refine the discovery process.
-   **Comprehensive Connection Management System**: PeerConnect provides robust tools for users to build and manage their professional network. This includes an intuitive system for sending, receiving, and managing connection requests (accept/decline). Users can easily view their existing connections, search within their network, and (in future iterations) simulate messaging.
-   **Detailed Profile Management & Showcase**: Users have full control over their profiles. They can view their public profile as others see it, and easily edit and update all sections of their information. This includes adding or modifying skills, interests, project details, and linking to external social/professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, personal portfolio).
-   **Dual Theme (Dark/Light Mode) & Accessibility**: To ensure a comfortable viewing experience in various lighting conditions and to cater to user preferences, PeerConnect offers a user-selectable theme (dark or light mode). This preference is saved locally and persists across browsing sessions, contributing to better accessibility.

## üöÄ Tech Stack & Design Philosophy

PeerConnect is built with a modern, robust, and scalable frontend architecture, prioritizing developer experience and user interface quality.

### Core Technologies:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) - Chosen for its hybrid static & server rendering, file-system routing, image optimization, and overall performance benefits, facilitating a fast and SEO-friendly application. The App Router enables a more organized and scalable project structure with server components and layouts.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and consistent styling. It enables building custom designs without writing custom CSS and is highly configurable to match the project's design system.
-   **UI Components**: [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Not a component library, but a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. These components are accessible, customizable, and can be copied directly into the project, offering full control over their code and styling.
-   **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - A powerful React animation library used to create fluid, interactive, and engaging user experiences with minimal effort. It simplifies complex animations and transitions.
-   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) - A comprehensive and simply beautiful open-source icon library. Provides a vast set of consistently designed SVG icons that are lightweight and easy to use.
-   **State Management**: React Context API + Local Storage - React Context is used for managing global UI state like themes and potentially user session information. Local Storage is leveraged for persisting user preferences (e.g., theme, view mode) and mock user data across browser sessions.
-   **Form Handling**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) + [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - React Hook Form offers performant, flexible, and easy-to-use form building capabilities. Zod is used for schema declaration and validation, ensuring data integrity and providing excellent TypeScript support for type-safe forms.
-   **Typography**: Inter (via Google Fonts) - A highly legible and versatile font family designed specifically for user interfaces, ensuring clarity and a modern aesthetic.

### Additional Libraries & Tools:

-   **Toast Notifications**: [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) - For displaying non-intrusive and customizable toast notifications for user actions (e.g., successful profile update, connection request sent).
-   **Client-Side Search**: [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) - A lightweight yet powerful fuzzy-search library, enabling efficient client-side searching and filtering of student profiles or other data sets within the application.
-   **Utility Libraries**:
    -   `clsx` & `tailwind-merge`: Essential utilities for conditionally joining class names and resolving Tailwind CSS class conflicts, leading to cleaner component code.
    -   `date-fns`: A modern JavaScript date utility library for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates in a simple and immutable way.

### Design System (Brief Overview):

-   **Color Palette**: A carefully selected color palette supports both light and dark themes, ensuring readability and visual appeal. Primary, secondary, accent, and status colors are defined as CSS variables for easy theming (see `src/app/globals.css`).
-   **Typography**: Consistent application of the Inter font family with a defined typographic scale (weights, sizes, line heights) for headings, body text, and captions to maintain visual hierarchy and readability.
-   **Layout & Spacing**: Adherence to a responsive grid system (likely using Tailwind's built-in grid) and a consistent spacing scale ensures a harmonious and adaptive layout across different screen sizes.
-   **Component Styling**: Components are styled using Tailwind CSS utilities, promoting reusability and consistency. Shadcn/ui components serve as a base, customized to fit the PeerConnect brand.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: v18.x or newer is recommended for compatibility with modern JavaScript features and Next.js.
-   **Package Manager**: Your choice of npm (comes with Node.js), yarn, pnpm, or bun.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL):
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd peerconnect
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** using your preferred package manager:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    # or
    # bun install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. The development server supports Fast Refresh, so changes made to source files (primarily within the `app/` and `components/` directories) will be reflected in the browser almost instantly.
