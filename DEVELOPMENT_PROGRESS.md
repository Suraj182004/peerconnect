## ðŸŒŸ Current Status

### âœ… What's Working
1. **Landing Page**: Fully functional with beautiful animations
2. **Onboarding Flow**: All 4 steps are present. Data saved to localStorage.
3. **Dashboard**: Basic layout with header, user profile view.
4. **Navigation**: Smooth routing between pages.
5. **Design System**: Consistent styling throughout.
6. **Mock Data**: Realistic student profiles and connections.
7. **Student Browse Page**: Basic structure, search, filtering UI, and sorting capabilities. Student cards display with connect functionality.

### ðŸ”§ Build Error Fixes & Workarounds (Recent)
- Manually created `checkbox.tsx` in `components/ui/` due to `shadcn add` command issues.
- Manually created `scroll-area.tsx` in `components/ui/` and installed its dependency `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area`.
- Manually created `sheet.tsx` in `components/ui/`. (Dependency `@radix-ui/react-dialog` to be installed).
- Fixed `PROJECT_AREAS` not being exported from `lib/types.ts` by defining and exporting it.
- Resolved linter errors in `lib/types.ts` by replacing `any` with `unknown` for `Activity.metadata` and `AppError.details`.

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Tasks
1. Ensure all Radix UI dependencies for manually added Shadcn components are installed (e.g., `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`).
2. Verify successful build after recent fixes and dependency installations.
3. Continue refining Student Browse Page:
    - Implement infinite scroll or pagination.
    - Polish filter interactions and ensure all filter categories work.
4. Implement Connection Management page.
5. Implement Profile Management page.
